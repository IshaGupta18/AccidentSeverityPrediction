## Accident Severity Prediction - Machine Learning Project

- Road Accidents have a huge economic and societal impact costing hundred of billions of dollar every year.  A study by the Department of Transportation's, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), placed a price tag of over a quarter-trillion dollars in 2010. A large part of these losses is caused by a small number of serious accidents. Reducing accidents, especially these serious accidents, is an important challenge.

- Objective of our project is to identify the key factors affecting the accident severity. Also, train a model which predicts:
    - Accident Severity - a number between 1 to 4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic

- We took the literature review and references from [Accident Risk Prediction based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data: New Dataset and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09638) and [Predicting Crash Injury Severity with Machine Learning Algorithm Synergized with Clustering Technique: A Promising Protocol](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/15/5497/pdf)

- In the initial stages of the project, we did the EDA of the above datasets and did feature engineering to come up with the most optimal dataset.

- Created baseline models:
    - Decision Tree
    - Logistic Regression

- Main Models:
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - SVM
    - Logistic Regression
    - ADA Boost
    - XG Boost
    - Neural Networks

- The files in the folder `Model Training Code` are used for creating the model dumps of the above 2+7 models and the weights are saved.
